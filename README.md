# Yukon (Java Edition)

## Introduction

Yukon is a compilation of tweaks for Java Edition. Most of them are designed to make content creation and server administration easier.

However, Yukon also includes changes that are designed to improve the game for all users. If you're interested, feel free to give them a try!

## Structure Voids

In Java Edition, any nearby Barriers and Light Blocks will show where they are located while you are holding the respective item. This is very useful, as the blocks are invisible.

By default, Structure Voids do not show where they are located when the respective item is being held. Yukon implements this behaviour for Structure Voids. This makes working with Structure Voids much easier, as they are invisible and have a much smaller hitbox.

## Reconnect Button

Yukon adds a "Reconnect" button to the screen that is shown when the player is disconnected. This can be used to quickly reconnect to the server.

*Note: To prevent misuse, Yukon does not provide the ability to automatically reconnect to servers. You will need to click the "Reconnect" button.*

## Debug Sticks

Yukon adds a unique texture for the Debug Stick. Since the features of the Debug Stick are like magic, why not give it a texture that makes it look like a magician's wand?

## Creative Inventory

Yukon adds items that are not listed by default to the Creative inventory. Some of these will only be visible if the Operator Utilities section is enabled.

• Uncraftable Potions/Tipped Arrows

• Knowledge Books

• Ender Dragon/Wither Spawn Eggs

• Petrified Oak Slabs

## F3 Key Binds

Yukon adds some additional F3 key binds. To see a list of them in game, you can use the F3 + F12 key bind.

• F3 + Y = Copy UUID to clipboard

This mod also restores key binds that were removed from the game. These will be listed alongside Yukon's key binds when the F3 + F12 key bind is used.

• F3 + R = Cycle render distance (shift to invert)

## Bug Fixes

Yukon includes a patch which adds translation strings that are missing by default. This includes the missing translations for numerous death messages and the missing translations for the "/warden_spawn_tracker" command.

By default, the Awkward, Thick, and Mundane Tipped Arrows use a generic name. This bug was reported over 6 years ago, but has yet to be fixed by Mojang (https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-158539).

Yukon addresses the problem by changing the translations for Awkward, Thick, and Mundane Tipped Arrows. This makes it much easier to differentiate between them.

## Installation

To install this mod, place the JAR file in your "mods" directory. You must also install the Fabric API.
